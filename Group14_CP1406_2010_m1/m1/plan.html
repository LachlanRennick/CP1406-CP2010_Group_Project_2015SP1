<H1>CP1406/CP2010 - 2015 - TCMC Project Plan</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Intellectual Property</H2>
<P><STRONG>Members:</STRONG> Boopathi Selvaraj, Lara Johnstone,
Lachlan Rennick, Micah Kravia, Nicholas Barber</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Mission Statement</H2>
<P>The purpose of this website is to increase the number of
volunteers and performers involved with the Townsville Community
Music Centre, to increase the involvement of their member base, to
promote their concerts and concert organising services and to
increase the ticket sales to their concerts.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Success Evaluation</H2>
<P>Seeing a measurable increase in the involvement of volunteers and
performers, increased concert attendance and measuring the
effectiveness of recruitment using the signup forms online will be
the methods used to determine success. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Target Audience</H2>
<P>The key demographic for this website is the musically inclined 40+
age group. As the TCMC caters towards a broad range of genres rather
than towards a single music genre, the website targets fans of all
styles of music and as such will maintain a partial grounding rather
than focus on a single style. In order to appeal to this demographic,
the website will aim for a more traditional rather than a
contemporary design, using elements that are more familiar to the
demographic; as such, a newspaper-esque design will be the primary
style used throughout the website.</P>
